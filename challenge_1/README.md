# Learn-to-earn Challenge 1

## Challenge Question

The first challenge is based around depositing secret messages from authorised users. The requirements of the challenge are to write a contract as specified below, plus tests to show the code is working.

### The process is as follows:

#### 1. An administrator will add eligible addresses via a UI.

There will be a maximum of 100 eligible addresses. You need to write a function in a contract to store the addresses, the function will have one parameter which is the address. Eligible addresses should be stored in a suitable data structure.

#### 2. A user with an eligible address can deposit a secret message of a certain format.

The message contains 6 flags at the end, each of size 1 bit. The rest of the message can be any number. You need to write a function to store the messages, the function will have one parameter which is the message. The message should be a Field, we use the last 6 bits as flags.

#### 3. The flags should be checked according to the following rules:

- If flag 1 is true, then all other flags must be false.
- If flag 2 is true, then flag 3 must also be true.
- If flag 4 is true, then flags 5 and 6 must be false.

#### 4. You should check that

- Addresses that are not eligible cannot deposit a message.
- An address can only deposit one message.
- If the above rules are passed, then an event should be emitted to show that a message has been received, and a counter updated to store the number of messages received.
- The sender's address and the message should be stored in a suitable data structure.

## Deliverables

A smart contract with the following functions

1. A function to store eligible addresses
2. A function to check and store messages
3. Tests to test these functions
